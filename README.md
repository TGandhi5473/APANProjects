## Project Overview
These projects are Kaggle-based competitions with no prize payouts which are showcases of my first forays into data science. I have addressed many of the common issues that appear in ML problems like class imbalances, data cleaning/preperation, model selection and validation concepts. MLModel focuses on price prediction using an ensemble model of XGBoost & Regression tactics to predict car prices. SampleClassifier is a classification focused dataset that focuses on eligibility for a government program. 

## Data Sources
The data sources are found on kaggle link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets Most are for academic purposes which fully comply with licenses. 

## Licensing Issues
Data sets are open-sourced and suitable for educational purposes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA for Car Analysis shows us relationships between the actual configurations of a car and performance which have some relationships with price.

## Data Cleaning and Model Preparation
Any column that had over 10% missing values was excluded because imputation was impractical at that point. 

## Modeling Approaches and Tuning
I used ensemble models for most of my modeling approaches because I felt that was the most appropriate for the problems discussed. 

## Results
I had some moderate results but I felt like my results could be improved. 

## Conclusion
My approach was definitely not the best way to address these problems as there were most steps I could have taken like cross-validation, data preperation steps, and other misc. approaches I did not know at the time. I hope to document these projects as a guide for what my baseline performance was and improve upon design choices, ensure data quality and other changes.
